            <p>
                September is associated in my mind with crafting - specifically, with sewing. 
                For a period in my childhood, my mother would sew Halloween costumes for my sister and 
                me, so early fall would find us visiting the fabric store, where we would look through 
                pattern books and plan our costumes. Most of all, I remember the palette of colors that 
                surrounded me on those trips: earthy reds and browns and vivid oranges, flowing through 
                the aisles of fabric bolts and winking from the pages of the pattern books. 
                In spite of the fluorescent lighting and bland linoleum floors of the store, those colors 
                made the place enchanting to me; they heightened my awareness of the many possible  
                forms that could be shaped from the materials around me, and of the potential for those forms 
                to reflect the larger world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Crochet, not sewing, is my craft of choice at the moment (though I hope to have a sewing 
                room sometime in the next few years). But no matter what crafting tools are at hand, the 
                impulse to make <span class="italic">something</span> is there - and it is strengthened, somehow, 
                by the change in season. No doubt that's partly because the prospect of cold 
                weather makes it very easy to envision new crochet projects - but part of the reason, too, 
                I think, must be that I was first introduced to the power and potential of craft 
                at this time of year.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for what I intend to make... Well, 
                if there's one thing I learned from my experiences last year, my first year of crocheting, it's 
                that the season very quickly gets ahead of my works in progress! So for this fall, I'm trying 
                not to saddle myself with a huge backlog of WIPs. I've started a raglan cardigan, which needs sleeves and about 
                twice its current length, and I'd also like to make a hat/scarf set out of some plum-colored 
                yarn that I bought last year. By the time I get through all of that, it may well be December. I 
                hope to record a few notes and photos as I go. We'll see!
